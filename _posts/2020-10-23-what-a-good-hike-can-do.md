title: What a good hike can do? 
---
1. get your steps for the day (~13.000).
2. lets you catch up on podcasts:
    - [Spooky Web Dev Stories â€” Part 1](https://syntax.fm/show/294/spooky-web-dev-stories-part-1)
    - [Hasty Treat - Stretching For Developers with Scott](https://syntax.fm/show/293/hasty-treat-stretching-for-developers-with-scott)
    - [112: Kent C. Dodds on Epic React](https://reactpodcast.com/episodes/112)
    - [Solve](https://solvehq.com/podcast/)
        - First time listening to it. Feels it would be a lot more enjoyable if you could take part into the investigation itself by chatting with other people, etc.
3. got a new side project idea (this one is the one, trust me!).
4. enjoy some fresh air and some rain.
5. makes you hungry.
