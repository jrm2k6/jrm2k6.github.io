title: To-Do list for new laptop setup (updated)
---

I had my personal Macbook for almost 10 years now, so it is bound to die anytime soon. Over the last year, I had to set up my development environment from scratch at least three times, due to a new job, some contracting work, and on a replacement laptop due to my battery dying.

As a reminder to myself, I think it could be smart to have a To-Do list handy for next time.
I will try to keep this list up to date, as I am doing it from memory right now.

## Applications

- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/): for windows management as I usually have 2/3 monitors on my day to day
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/): my favorite Git GUI for no particular reason
- Visual Studio Code: has been my IDE of choice for a few years now
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): for note taking and work journal
- 1Password: used for password management
- Flux: takes care of the ligthing of my screen as time goes by
- ITerm: my terminal of choice
- Sequel Pro: GUI for MySql

## Command line libraries
- tree (through `brew install tree`) to display directory structures as a nicely laid out tree.

## Tools

- nvm: most of my work is in javascript nowadays so `nvm` is super handy to switch node versions on the fly
- [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/): I use the `agnoster` theme.
- [AWS Extend Switch Roles](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aws-extend-switch-roles/jpmkfafbacpgapdghgdpembnojdlgkdl) Chrome extension: to make switching AWS profiles a breeze!
- [The Great Suspender No Track](https://github.com/aciidic/thegreatsuspender-notrack): I tend to have a lot of tabs open so I like this extension to unload them after an hour or so if there is no activity.
