#### iheartreading.co / web application

iheartreading.co is (was.. 🙁) an easy-to-use platform that allows students to track their reading, submit responses to reading and start a conversation, through comments, with their teacher about a book they are reading. Making reading a habit can be difficult for students. I Heart Reading helps students build regular reading habits by allowing them to add books, update their progress (number of pages read, books finished) and write reviews about books they have enjoyed. All of the responses to reading, reviews and progress the student inputs into the site are accessible to their teacher, making it a simplified and streamlined solution to independent reading.
