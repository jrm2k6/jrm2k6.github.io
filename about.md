My name is Jeremy Dagorn.
I am currently working at Ebates as a software engineer. I love to learn, write code, criminology, startups and too many other stuff to fit on this page.

Before working at Ebates, I was a software engineer at Curology for a year, and at Prezi for more than 2 years. I like to travel, that's why I lived in France, USA, Canada, and Hungary. I love to learn new languages, and I have a secret love for functional programming, even if I am still a beginner (this has been true for 3 years now).

You can also reach out to me on [Github](https://github.com/jrm2k6) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jrm2k6).
