My name is Jeremy Dagorn.
I am currently working at Robin Healthcare as a full-stack software engineer. I love to learn, write code, criminology, startups and too many other stuff to fit on this page.

Before joining Robin in March 2019, I worked at Adroll, Ebates, Curology and Prezi. I like to travel, that's why I lived in France, USA, Canada, and Hungary. I love to learn new languages, and I have a secret love for functional programming, even if I am still a beginner (this has been true for 4 years now). I have also starting poking around with more DevOps work, which I love so far.

You can also reach out to me on [Github](https://github.com/jrm2k6) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jrm2k6).
